PlaceholderAPI extension to replace underscores with anything you like.

## Usage:

`%replaceunderscores_<replacement>_text%`

## Examples:

`%replaceunderscores_ _diamond_axe%` -> `diamond axe`

`%replaceunderscores_/_my name is mfn_alex%` -> `my name is mfn/alex`

`%replaceunderscores_123456789_test_message%` -> `test123456789message`

## Note
This is a standalone plugin that hooks into PAPI, not an ecloud extension. You'll have to put the .jar into your plugins/ folder and restart the server.
